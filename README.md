Predicting House Prices With Regression.

A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

So I took advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and used it to analyze and predict house prices.

Given historical data on house features, I built a model that can predict the price of that house. By passing some informations and features of a house, this model can predict the price of that house.
